## What is it?

[A website](4fbcprg2rsx5t7ah.onion) where you can leave messages.  They last for a week.

## How does it work?

* Raspberry pi in my living room for the hardware
* Lighttpd for the server
* Memcached for the transient message store 
* PHP for the pages
* Javascript for the ajax
* Go (Golang) for an external service that generates tokens
* Bash for the setup scripts
* [Tor for the domain name](4fbcprg2rsx5t7ah.onion)

I hacked it together in an afternoon after accidentally eating seven (7) slices of pizza, then feeling too sick to go out.

## Where is it?

## TODO?

Enable ssl.  I've done it before, but I can't remember off the top of my head.

## License?

Public domain.  But if you use any part of it, send me an email?  I like those.
